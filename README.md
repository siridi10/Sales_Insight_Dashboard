Hello Everyone,

I would like to say this is my first PowerBI Dashboard that have recently created to generate sales insights for AtliQ Technologies.
Learning from this project:-
1. Getting data from MYSQL database to PowerBI
2. Creating different relationships between tables
3. Performing data cleaning in PowerBI
4. Creating new measures using DAX
5. Creating Bar charts, Pie charts, Donut charts, Slicers, Area chart, Line and Clustered column chart and buttons
6. Displaying different colors for the bars based on condition Building Dashboards , Publish and Sharing the Dashboards to public
7. You can interact with the dashboard by clicking the below link
